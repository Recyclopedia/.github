**Summary:**

Dealing with waste problems in Indonesia should begin with educating people about waste management from an early age. According to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2023, there are 5,847,822.52 (tons/year) of waste that is not managed properly. So this requires follow-up that can reduce waste that is not managed properly. Based on these problems, what is an effective way for the community to participate in waste management efforts in Indonesia? How to reduce waste production through an educational approach on how to manage waste properly? Therefore, the goal of our project is to create an application that can help people from children to adults to distinguish the types of waste and how to deal with the waste they find. We want to involve the role of technology and society to support the ESG Program. With our innovation, users just need to scan the type of waste found, then the application will display how to recycle it into useful items. After that, every people can practice it and then collect the processed results to our application to get points for processing waste. Therefore, with everyone participating in recycling waste around us, waste can be turned into more useful items to support ESG programs in Indonesia.
